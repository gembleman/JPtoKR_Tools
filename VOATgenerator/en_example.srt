1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
and says, how do I get to Dublin?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer that comes back is,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
well, I wouldn't start from here, Sonny.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That is to say, much of political philosophy

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
develops theories that take no account

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
of where we actually are and how the theories

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that people argue about in the journals

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and in the literature actually could be implemented

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in the world, if at all.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this spills over into normative arguments

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
made by other scholars.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thomas Piketty, in his book, Capital in the 21st Century,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
argues for a 4% global wealth tax.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, good luck with that.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who's gonna implement a 4% global wealth tax?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So when I think about normative questions,
